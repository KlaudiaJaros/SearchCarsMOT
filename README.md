# SearchCarsMOT
A simple interface that allows the user to search a CSV file with MOT information by specifing a make, model or year (or any combination of the three) of a car and then have the corresponding data displayed in a list box. 
A user have the option of ordering results by year, pass or fail (ascending or descending). An export function writes the results of any query to a CSV file in the format: "make, model, year, total", where total is the total number of tests undertaken (pass + fail).
